## Simple App Guide

[Click here to visit the Site](https://davidquindoza.github.io/parentGuidebook/)

The idea behind the Parental Guidebook for Computer/Mobile related Tasks are for my parents to be able to do the things I normally would do for them in the tech side of things.

This guide aims to be helpful while im not around the house due to work.

The site utilizes the Jekyll Theme: JustTheDocs to provide an easy navigation menu to list all the tutorials.
