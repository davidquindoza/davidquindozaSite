# Professional Experience

## Analyst - AI & Data (January 2024 ‚Äì Present)
My experience at Deloitte has allowed me to develop a robust foundation in delivering and collaborating on end-to-end data solutions for international clients across diverse sectors like finance and operations. The following highlights my relevant industry experiences:

### International Client, SG:
* Leveraging **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, I built comprehensive data models and transformation workflows using **BigQuery, Dataflow, and Dataform**. This involved migrating consumption layer tables to semantic layers via **LookML** to power business intelligence visualizations in **Looker**.

* Addressed client inquiries by creating tailored user guides (in PowerPoint) and conducting live demo sessions. These resources clearly demonstrated solution functionality and replication within client environments, including showcasing **Agentic AI's** power in **Looker** through **Conversational Analytics**, **Gemini's** capabilities in **Dataprep** for accelerating data pipelines, and **Data Canvas** for efficient data investigations.

### International Client, MY:
* Utilized **Fivetran** for the **data ingestion** process and implemented Google Cloud Platform (**BigQuery**) stored procedures to transform and prepare data for comprehensive reporting solutions.

* Handled Warranty Period Maintenance by monitoring post-project data movement to ensure system stability and optimal performance.

### Generative AI Platform, SG:
* Collaborated on updating comprehensive workflow documentation for Generative AI solutions.

* Expanded data pipeline functionality by adding new data columns and features.
