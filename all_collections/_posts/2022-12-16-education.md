As an information systems graduate, I have gained valuable experience in analyzing complex business problems, identifying gaps and requirements, and implementing solutions through websites, mobile apps and data driven storyboards. Through these tools and methods, I have developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking. 

#### Tools and Methods used in Case Studies:

- Process Maps w/ Pain points
- Why-Why Diagrams
- Flow Charts
- Business Requirements 
- Design Thinking 
- Process Chart Analysis (VA/NVMA/NVA Analysis)
 
### Skills:

- HTML/CSS
- Jekyll
- Angular
- Java 
- Android Studio
- Python and Jupyter Notebook
- SQL 
- SAP Analytics Cloud

As an aspiring data analyst, my proficiency in these technical skills allows me to efficiently navigate large datasets and perform data analysis using a variety of tools and programming languages. Through my experience with case studies, process mapping, and other analysis techniques, I have honed my ability to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and draw insights from complex data. These skills enable me to contribute to an organization by providing valuable data-driven recommendations and aiding in effective decision-making.

In addition, I also had notable experience in Data Analytics as participating and getting into the National Finals of the [2020 ASEAN Data Explorers Competition](#asean-data-explorers-2020-finals-entry).
