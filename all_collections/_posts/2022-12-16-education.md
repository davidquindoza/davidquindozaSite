My course in Information Systems familiarized us with case studies, identifying problems, analyzing them, identifying requirements/filling the gap, what to measure, implementing the change. 

#### Tools and Methods used in this whole process were:

- Case Analysis
- Process Maps w/ Pain points
- Why-Why Diagrams
- Flow Charts
- Business Requirements 
- Design Thinking 
- Process Chart Analysis (VA/NVMA/NVA Analysis)
 

I think the same process can be applied with Quality Assurance in testing the product first to meet user requirements, what can be improved before delivering final product. 

Moving on to the technical skills from the course were the opportunity to learn and familiarise the following

## Technical Familiarities:
---
- HTML/CSS and TypeScript using Angular
- Jekyll
- Java 
- Android Studio
- Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Figma (UI/UX)

The Term System is prototype of an Auto Shop System with an online ticketing with scheduling feature. Creates a ticket from customer bookings, that is regularly updated with the car's progress in the auto shop. It also shows lead/idle time in between mechanics switching of work.
